# Basics of Data Science

This folder has a bunch of the little projects done using basic data science algorithms and methods

The models used:
* Linear Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Lasso Regression
* Support Vector Machine 
* Gradient Boosted Decision tree
* Logistic Regression
* Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent training
* Simple Dense Neural Network


Most of these notebooks are just base implementations or applications of the models from another package. All of 
these models were implemented by hand in class before jumping into implementing anything.
